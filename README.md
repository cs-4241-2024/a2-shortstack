## Inflation* Over Time
The program I created takes a product, the cost of the product at release, and the year it was released, and uses inflation rates to try to calculate how much the product will cost today. Since inflation rates vary year by year and there isn't a concrete way to create an accurate inflation rate for each year, the program uses 3.28%, the current long term average inflation rate in the US, as the inflation rate.

TO-DO List
I created a small todo list that lets you add information to a list
Technical Achievements
Tech Achievement 1: Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.
I was able to complete this achievement. This can be seen when entering a task into the to do list
In addition to a form enabling adding and deleting data on the server, also add the ability to modify existing data.
I was also able to complete this achievement. All input data should be modifiable within the table

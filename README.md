## Tetris Leaderboard
Click on the title (anchor) to play a game of tetris. 
Once you are done, report your name, the day, and your final score. 
The website will track your place on the scoreboard.
If you don't want to play, feel free to press show leaderboard.

Everything is centered, with the form being a flex row, and the leaderboard button/table being a flex column.

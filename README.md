Reaction Time Test

The user clicks on the big red box and waits for it to turn green. Once the box is green, the user clicks on it and text will display how long it took the user to click in ms. The user can then input their name into the popup box, which displays it alongside other times.

CSS styling:

I changed the background color of the body to rgb(56, 54, 61) so that it contrasts with the red and green boxes, as well as the white reaction time test text. I also put the click box in its own container so that I could align objects to the center of the screen. I adjusted the width of the click box to 200px with a height of 300px and adjusted it according to the flexbox in the container class. I then aligned it to the center and made the starting color red. When you hover over it, the cursor turns into a pointer. I added some padding to the text inside the box and aligned it to the center. I also changed the color to white so that the user can see it when the box is both red and green. I adjusted the size of the highscore table and made the background aqua so that it is visible.

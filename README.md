## CS4241 Assignment 2 Arayah Remillard

My project is supposed to hold a list of 3 already stored video game characters that can be added to (and deleted from, but it doesnt work). 
The information stored is the name, debut year, and a color the character may be associated with. 
The fields are not strict with the input, so things do not need to be accurate to still be entered. 
A good input example to match the theme of Sonic characters already stored would be: "Amy Rose"; "1993"; "Pink"
The derived attirbute "existence" is caluclated based on the year the user entered in the "debut" field and the current year.
Within main.css, I added various stlying to the different elements I used on the page. I implemented flexbox organization as my CSS positioning technique.

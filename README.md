## To-Do List
This is an application that allows users to create a to-do list. This is done by entering the task name, task description and priority  (low, medium, high) into the provided form. Based on the priority of the inputed task, the app will calculate a deadline for that task to be completed. This app also shows the current list of tasks in a table, and users are also able to delete tasks from the table as well as edit the task name, description and priority of the task. To delete a task, simply click the delete button on the task you want to delete and to edit, click on the attribute you want to edit and it should allow you to modify it. I used CSS to style the primary elements and I used flexbox for positioning, as well as class, elemement and ID selectors.

## Technical Achievements
- My application is a single page application; the form takes up the top half of the page while the table of tasks occupies the bottom half.
- Users can also edit and delete tasks; this is automatically updated in both the server and client side.
### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- I did not have time to complete the think aloud protocol, but I ran into a few issues with my application that would potentially hinder the user experience. The first was that the edit priority feature was a bit subpar, you had to use the keyboard to toggle between priority levels. I would definitely try to make more user friendly in that aspect in the future. It was also not really obvious how to edit the tasks in the table as there aren't any indications within the table that you are able to edit its contents. To fix this, I think I would either add something within each box that allows you to edit or I would just add an edit button under the actions column in addition to the delete button that allows you to edit all attributes of the task.

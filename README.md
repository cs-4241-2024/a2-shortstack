## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I've created a single-page app in which users submit a form of two values and a math operator. After submitting, an equation is displayed on the page using the two values with the math operator, also showing its result. When the user submits again with different values or a different operator, the equation and its result are updated to match the current fields inputed.

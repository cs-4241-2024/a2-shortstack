## (Grocery) Shopping List!

Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js

This project is a shopping list where you enter the name of the item you are planning to buy, its price, and its quantity. The information is entered into the table and the total cost for the item (price * quantity) is calculated. I used flexbox for positioning and centered the website form and table on the page. 

Use the 'edit' button to edit the name, price, or quantity of your item. You can exit the edit window to cancel your changes. Press the 'save' button to save your changes.

Use the 'delete' button to delete an entered row.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that updates front-end based on data sent to server and back. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Added the ability to edit existing data. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Used the think-around protocol to obtain feedback from two different people. 

1. Last name: Poulsen
2. When he tried to modify the 'banana' item he added, it added the 'cherry' item. (This might have just been from the form refreshing after the edit functionality, because I added that cherry item before I sent the link to him to try.)
3. He said the colors looked awesome; the website overall looks great and he mentioned it was very intuitive to navigate. 
4. Next time I will refresh the Glitch server before sending my website to a friend to evaluate. 

1. Last Name: Riley
2. They recommended that my 'price' column should have a currency attached to it; they mentioned it seemed a bit weird without it. 
3. They really liked my edit window and website overall!
4. If I have more time to edit the website later, I can work on integrating some type of currency based on location, or I can just autofill those boxes with '$' and make the currency USD.

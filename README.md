Instructions:
1. Enter in your name, your favorite cookies, and your favorite type of ice cream. Add any extra comments in 'other'. 
2. After hitting enter, your data will now be displayed on the screen. As well as a new field "cake". The cake is chosen based off of your favorite flavors of other items.

The CSS positing technique I used was both grid and flexbox. The box was used for both the table and the form. 
The grid was used to lay out the form so that the user has a neat few to enter in data. 

This project was a good level of difficulty. 
It really helped me learn how data moves from html, through both the front-end and back-end sides of JavaScript. 
I learned a lot from the TA/SA's as well as doing research online and that helped greatly. 

The program is quite simple, although it helps display the back-end and the data that is stored in the server. Along with introducing the derived field : cake. 

## Technical Achievements
- Using a combination of form and JavaScript to post the results in a table. The user can enter data as well as see the data stored in the database.

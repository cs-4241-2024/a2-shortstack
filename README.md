## Your Web Application Title
For my project I created a Guest list book where you can add guests' names on a list. This website you would be for events where you
need to check people in.

To use this website all you need to do is put the name of your uest in the top text bar and hit submit. That person will then show up
below in the list section. To remove, check-in, or edit the person just click the corresponding buttons.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I added server side logic where it displays the list of all the names in database (a array called appdata).
                          On the server side as well it will count the length of then name and display it for each name (derived field).
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I added a edit, delete, and check in button where you can change the status of the names

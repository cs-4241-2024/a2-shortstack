# Workout Logger Fast (WlF)
[Glitch](https://a2-liamsnow.glitch.me/)
Do you find yourself wasting time during your workout logging
every set on your workout app? Do you feel like this is a waste
of time but still want some data?

If so, look no further than WlF! With WlF, theres no need
to log things perfectly. You can simply write `225lbs 4x8`
for an exercise, which is good enough for future reference
(even if not exact). Its easy enough that you can simply
log your workout at the end in a few minutes, so you
can have a distraction free workout.

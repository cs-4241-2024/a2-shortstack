## Your Web Application Title
My Application allows users to create a fantasy football table that shows both dynasty and PPR (Points Per Reception) rankings. 
It also calculates the rank difference(delta) for each player inputted.
The single-page app's layout was done with CSS flexbox.
Instructions
To add a player use the top form on the left (MAKE SURE to input all the fields)
To delete a player use the bottom form on the left (write the id of the player you want to delete)
To edit a player click the "edit" button to the right of their row in the table, make your changes, then press save (same place as edit button)

## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page App**: A single page app was implemented with forms on the right to add or delete players. When a player is added or deleted the page updates automatically.
- **Edit feature**: all records can be edited by pressing the edit button on the right of the record (make sure to click save to save the change)

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Student Feedback 1**: Last Name: Le
  - **What problems did the user have with your design?**
  - When asked to delete a player Le clicked on the edit button next to the player first before noticing the form on the left.
    - Although this is likely because the first instruction he was told to perform was to edit a player.
  - When adding a player Le failed to notice that all the fields contained placeholder values.
  - **What comments did they make that surprised you?**
  - Le could not tell that the player add form had placeholder text, and expressed his surprise.
  - **What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?**
  - Add alert or make it more obvious (different text color) that all field need to be filled out to input a player.

- **Student Feedback 2**: Last Name: Lewis
  - **What problems did the user have with your design?**
  - Initially, Lewis failed to fill out all of the form when adding a player
  - **What comments did they make that surprised you?**
  - Lewis found the player id placeholder text in the delete form confusing, and expressed his frustration on how unclear the text was.
  - **What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?**
  - change placeholder text in delete form to be more obvious on what value it is asking for.

Assignment 2: Sophia John

## Daily Journal
This project is a website where you are able to journal as often as you want. You are able to add and delete entries as well as display them. Based on how motivated or happy you are
the website will calculate whether you had a good day or not.
There are four inputs for the user: the date, an entry, a rating from 1-5 of how happy you are, and a rating from a 1-5 of how motivated you are. To delete an entry enter in a date and all entries from that date will be deleted. To show all journal entries press "Display Journal Entries."

In this project I used a flex box to help with the projects layout. I also used borders as well as imported fonts using google. I used a table to display the data, used html forms, made my website single paged, and used class and id sectors.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: My website is single paged and it always shows the current state of the server-side data - journal entries displayed will always automatically update when an entry has been added or deleted. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1 and 2**: The task I assigned was for both users was to add and delete a journal entry.

1. Foley
2. Thought I should have something so my rating sections are clearer (have instructions so the user knows what to input).
3. Suggusted naming my button to "Display Journal Entries" instead of "Past Journal Entries", I thoght this was clear enough but to another user it wasn't. 
4. I changed the button to "Past Journal Entries" and I also included clearer instructions so users in the future aren't faced with any problems/questions.


1. Jacob
2. When submit was clicked (initially) you didn't see any updates until you reclicked "Display Journal Entries" so user got confused by that and didn't think a journal entry had been submitted.
3. I also realized based on this confusion ^^ that I should make things easier for the user and that my website isn't as clear as it could be.
4. I changed the buttons so that after submit and delete are pressed the changes are displayed instantaneosly instead of having to reclick "Display Journal Entries" to see the updates.

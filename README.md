## Events
I created a webpage that displays and stores events which can be added to and edited on the same page. I used a flexbox to align the entries along the center of the page.
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Integrated viewing, adding and editing onto one single page.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Allow editing of previous events.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Created an "edit mode" where fields were read-only, and added some simple validation to the fields.

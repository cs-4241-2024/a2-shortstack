## CS4241 Assignment 2
In this project I created a To do list that determines when you should complete a task by the priority you give it. Tasks with higher priority should be completed before tasks with lower priority. Priority level 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. Users are able to both delete and add to the list and have it update live in front of them.

## Technical Achievements

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Conducted one think-aloud protocol in person
    - Last Name: Wright
    - Problems: The centered alignment of everything feels off and the data being displayed is very small font
    - Comments: The idea that the deadline is calculated based on the prrority given to it is not very clear
    - I would make the font of the data bigger, however I am still unsure about not having it center alligned. I feel like the centering gives it a good flow of control.

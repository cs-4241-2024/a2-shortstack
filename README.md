Hello, I got an extention until tonight 9/10 for this assignment



## Guess The Password
I made a password guessing game, enter a password and then use the clues provided by the website to try and figure out the password. 
I used a flexbox to center the form.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I have made the webpage an interactive web app that updates its information in real time.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I have interviewed two people about the sites design:

person 1: Pollak 

  What problems did the user have with your design?
  1. does not like that guesses are shared between clients
  2. found the number of correct letters field confusing
  3. table colums don't wrap for large entries

  What comments did they make that surprised you?
  1. I found that confusion with the number of correct letters hint to be a bit suprising, but I think that is just cause I made it and know how it works.
  
  What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
  1. I would add a clarification to the number of correct letters hint, and I would have password entries wrap.



person 2: Siegall

  What problems did the user have with your design?
  1. table elements are a bit cramped on moble
  2. the color scheme might not be accessable for everyone
  
  What comments did they make that surprised you?
  1. the color scheme not being accessable was surprising as I forgot to consider accessability in my design
  
  What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
  1. I would alter the color scheme to be more accessable

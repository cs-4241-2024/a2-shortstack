This webpage allows you to submit and keep track of scores for various arcade games, by submitting a name, game and score. The server also automatically generates a letter rank
for each score based on the numeric range the score falls in. You can also delete records with the delete button, but it will only delete one record whose name, game and score
exactly matches the input given. CSS positioning techniques used include the use of margins.

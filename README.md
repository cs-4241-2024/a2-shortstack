## D&D 5e Wizard Spell Slot Tracker
My application tracks spell slot usage for wizards in Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.
At different levels, wizards have access to different amounts and levels of spell slots.
The wizard's level can be changed using the submission box, and the spell slots can be
used or regained using their respective buttons. A long rest restores all spell slots.

My page uses the box model for CSS.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-Page App**: My app is only a single page.
- **Modifying Data**: My app is capable of modifying the server's data through using and
regaining spell slots. Also, a long rest will return the data to its default for the wizard's
level.

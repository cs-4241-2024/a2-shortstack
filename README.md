## Game Wishlist

My application is a wishlist where a user can input a game, its genre, its cost, and a discount, and the server will calculate the cost after the discount before putting it in a table. Users can also delete games from the table, which updates on the same page. I used a flexbox with a column direction to center everything on the page, as well as center the text within the table. Directions are on the page, but please make sure to not include $ or % when inputting the cost and discount because it displays those by default and will mess up calculations.

## Technical Achievements

- **Single Page App**: The form for users to submit data and the current server-side data are both displayed on the same page, which is updated every time the user submits data. The challenging part about this was figuring out how to update the data display immediately after data input.
- **Deleting Data**: Users can delete specific rows of data using delete buttons on the right side of the table. The most challenging parts of this were adding new delete buttons into the table and figuring out how to associate them with the correct table index.

## My Computer Science Assignments :)
This project is a single-page web application that allows users to manage their computer science assignments. Users can add new assignments, view the list of current assignments, edit existing assignments, and delete assignments. The application uses a form to submit data and dynamically updates the displayed data without requiring a page reload. The assignments include details such as the assignment name, points, score, and difficulty level.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-page App**: The application is now a single-page app that provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. When the user submits data, the server responds with the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server), and the client updates its data display.
- **Modify Existing Data**: Added the ability to modify existing data. Users can now edit and delete data entries directly from the table. The server handles PUT requests for modifying data and DELETE requests for removing data.

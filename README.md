Think-Aloud: Aaron Z

Task 1: Add Grocery Item
Add apple, description, red apple, price 2.95, tax 3 percent
Click submit


Task 2: Edit Grocery Item

Add second apple field: that is duplicate of task one's
Click edit button by item.
Edit to change description to green apple, price to 4.95.
Click submit.

Task 3: Delete an Item

Click delete button next to red apple item
Item deleted from list

Aaron was confused since the tax field said percent, but the field has to be entered as a decimal point
He also suggested a lighter CS color scheme.

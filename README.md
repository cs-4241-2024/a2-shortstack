Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  

## Your Web Application Title
I created a todo application that allows users to create to do items with dates and types. the derrived field is priority and it is created by the type and date value. the priority is ordered by work, school, then personal. And within the type fo work, it is further ordered by date. It is one page, displays all the current data when opened, , uses table to display data, I used a form and flexboxes. I have all the requirments listed for the assignment and the ability to delete and add items. I also have it on a single page.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: single page with form that always displays updated data whenever the submit button is clicked
- **Tech Achievement 2**: adding and deleting funcionality included

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
I tested out my UI with two students. Their last names are Wright and Smith.

Wright:
Really liked the functionality of the page, would suggest the ability to change priority on the tasks. Currently the derrived field is priority and it is made by listing work above school, and school above personal, and within the type, ordering by date. I might want to make it more clear how priority is calculated and allow the user to change it if needed.

Smith:

He liked the application but suggests that I change up the css file a bit to emphasize the different types of items(work, personal and school). This way you can see a bit more of a differentiation in the table. He also suggests emphasizing the high priority tasks with bold.

Glitch: https://a2-hannatrinh.glitch.me
Match Me is a simple shape game where players match colored shapes to their silhouettes. Each turn, the game shuffles the shapes to increase difficulty and keep the game engaging. The project is written in JavaScript and run using Node.js. The app utilized MongoDB as the backend which stores player name, score, and time.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **CRAP Principles**: I used a lot of contrast with the colours which were a mix of cream, pink, and purple to keep all elements easily identifable. Repetition was the use of div elements which was repeated throughout the page. Additionally, I used alignment by keeping everything center, even the whole game itself is centered and made so smaller, which made it a simple game. Finally, I used proximity with the shapes and scores to keep elements easily identifiable.

## Laura's Tea Log
My website is designed to be a personal tea log. You can put in the type of tea, when you had it, and your rating, and the server will add a note based on the rating. If all three fields are left blank under the "Add to Log" section, then a blank row will NOT be added. Therefore, if you refresh the page and then click the sumbit/show results button, it should display the data as it was before you refreshed the page. For the Edit Log Entry part, you can choose to edit any of the 3 fields (type, day, rating). If you choose not to update a certain field, just leave that textbox empty.

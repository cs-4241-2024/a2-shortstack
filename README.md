## Workout Logger


https://a2-samnaik10.glitch.me/ 

This project allows you to enter logs for your workouts by filling out a form. You can select what body part you worked on, the date, start time and end time. Based on the start and end time, it calculates the total minutes spend working out.

CSS: 
- I used flexbox for the layout of this project
- I used Merriweather for all the text from Google Fonts
- I added background color, and borders to the input labels and table
- CSS Selector functionality
    - Element selectors: body, table, label, input, h1, button and h3
    - ID selectors: flex-container
    - Class selector: main labels

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that provides a form to submit workout logs. The client side displays the current state of the server-side data and also derives a field to show the total time. The client updates the data table when a new log is added or a log is deleted. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

Student #2:
1. Wright
2. The user entered an end time that came before the start time which showed negative time in the derived column.
3. They didn't make any other comments.
4. I would add error handling and restrictions on the values that can be put in to make the form more realistic.

# Todo List

### Technical Achievements
#### Real-Time Data Updates
Implemented a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to submit data through a form. Upon submission, the server responds with updated data, including any derived fields calculated server-side. The client-side interface updates immediately to display the current data state.

Challenges:

Ensuring the client-side display updated correctly in real-time was complex due to asynchronous server responses.
Synchronizing the form submission and data display required careful handling of API calls and state management.


### Design/UX Achievements
#### User Interface Testing
Conducted user interface testing with peers to evaluate the usability of the application. Users were given a specific task to complete and provided feedback using the think-aloud protocol.

Test Details:

Participants: Boothroyd, Kratman
Task: Users were asked to submit a new entry then delete a record using the provided interface.

Each participant commented on how it was simple, but that was also a benifit. There were no struggles completeing the tasks, and only a little bit of trial and error to get a feel of the due-by-date weighting system.

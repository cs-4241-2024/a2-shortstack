## To-Do Manager
My project is a To-Do manager which will keep track of all the assignments you have to do. You give it a title a due date and a priority you give to the assignment and it will calculate the urgency you need to give to that assignment. This is based on the due date and the priority given, if the due date is 2 or fewer days from the current date it will add +5 to the urgency if it's 7 or fewer days from the current date it will add +2 and the rest will just give +1 urgency. If it's a high priority add 5 if it's medium add 3 and low will add 1 to the total urgency of that task. For this assignment, I used the CSS positioning of flex and was able to complete all required tasks. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Create a responsive single page app**:  Created a page where a user can submit an assignment to do and assign a due date with this the server calculates the urgency of that task based on date and priority.

- **Edit functionality on an entry in the table**: Implemented edit functionality where a user has a task in the task table they can edit the fields and the server recalculates the task's urgency. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **User Test**:  Sebastian Gurgol was kind enough to test my web app. I task him with creating a new task editing it and then deleting the task to test all the functionality of the To-Do manager.  He encountered problems trying to edit an entry in the table. Said it wasn't intuitive how to edit. What surprised me was that he liked the date picker and the selector of priority. To this end, I would research how to have the same date picker and priority selector on edit such that it has a user-friendly design. Now I needed to have them on the entry of the table so that the user doesn't have to look for them. I had a bit of free time so I implemented said changes to the app.

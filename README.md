## Assignment Tracker
I am updating this as if it is a portfolio with each new assignment. For the current assignment please go to assignment tracker. Here you will see a site that allows you to add and delete assignments. The site allows you to put the class, the assignment name, the due date, and when you would like to start the assignment.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used java script to create a assignment tracker that I user can input data into, see the inputed data and delete the inputed data.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used CSS to display the website, and color cordinate the website based on my color pallet from the last assignment.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: The Task I gave Ash was to "Add a new assignment with the class name 'Math', assignment name 'Homework 1', due date '2024-09-15', and start date '2024-09-10'. Then, edit this assignment to change the due date to '2024-09-20' and delete it." The instructions I gave Ash was to input all the data for the given assignment into the correct text boxes the hit submit, then delete. It was done remotely through text as I was sick this past weekend. He did not feel comfortable recording himself but provided the feedback that the site was easy to use and straight to the point. Full Name: Ashton Kittur. No problems were encountered. He asked me to include a feature that allowed him to edit the assignments.

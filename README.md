## Assignment 2 - Owen Rago
https://a2-owenrago.glitch.me/

I create a task organizing website for this assignment. All of the fields except the Priority (Calculated Field) are editable by clicking on them. In order to save changes to the server the save button must be clicked. A row can be added by clicking the add row button, once saved Priority will be re/calculated. There is also a delete button that deletes its row.

I used flexbox as my CSS styling technique for the website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page app that allows for the table to be changed and viewed from only one page.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: I added the ability to edit some values by clicking on there square and changing them.

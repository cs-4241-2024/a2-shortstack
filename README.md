## Overview
This project is a simple activity tracker web application in which users can record their daily activities such as work, play and sleep. Users can fill out forms for each activity, submit forms, view a list of all activities, and edit or delete entries. The application uses basic HTML forms, JavaScript for dynamic functionality, and a Node.js server to process incoming data.

### Technical Achievements
1: Implemented dynamic form loading using JavaScript. The form changes based on the user's activity selection, displaying different fields for work, play, and sleep.
2: Built an editable form using JavaScript and HTML that allows users to modify or delete activities after submission.
3: A backend Node.js server handles form submissions and stores activity data. It also handles GET and POST requests and serves static files.

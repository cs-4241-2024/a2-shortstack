Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
---

## To-Do List Application
This project is a basic to-do list, with the ability to add, delete, and edit entries.
Simply fill in the information and hit submit. The data will automatically appear on screen in the table, 
alongside buttons to delete or edit each row. The server derives the "Priority" field by comparing the
deadline date to the current date. This page uses display:flex and flex-direction:column, as well as
the Roboto Mono font from Google Fonts.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:
This is a single-page application that allows users to submit, view, and delete data all on one page.
Using the forms and the REST API, the server and the client communicate to each other to process the 
data while the server maintains the results table.

- **Tech Achievement 2**:
This application also gives the user the ability to modify existing data in the results table.

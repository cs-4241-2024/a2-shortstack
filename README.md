## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1: Create a single-page app for users to submit data and show the current state of server data** 
This was completed by after prompting the user for a whole number, as well as one of 4 words to indicate a calculation type, the data of the 2 choices that were made are shown in a new row on screen while as well displaying the current total sum of all calculations that a user has preformed. It as well has a function to remove a row of data as many times as needed, thus making the grand total sum of the calculations a user has preformed alwyas be displayed in the last box of the table. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1: Test your user interface with other students in the class**: 
Given prompt for user test:
I asked the user to use the calculatior to generate the number 45 using any amount of calculations you see fit. You must use each one of the 4 calculations listed at least once to do so.

1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with:      
Cole Welcher & Brittany Ficarra
2. What problems did the user have with your design?:      
There really wern't any problems, just the idea of moving the kill button to the middle of the screen with the rest of the objects. As well, the indication of the starting value 0 being written in the box instead of somewhere more visible was somehting that I can understand changing. It was a bit weird that you would be able to type decimal points into the first box, however the number would not register if that way typed in so that did not change much. 
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?:      
Just the word choice for my buttons. Kill seemed funny to them, so I kept it. 
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?:      
What I stated in part 2, both of those changes are quite simple as well as that they would make the site look a bit cleaner.

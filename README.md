This project shows a webpage that includes all of the assignment requirements and some of the optional achievements.

## Homework List
My project allows the user to track their homework by filling in assignment details and how many days are left which are then displayed in a table along with the due date which is derived based off of how many days are left and the current date. For the CSS positioning I used flexbox with it having all of the body elements positioned in a column flex-direction. To use the application fill in the text boxes and click submit to add a new assignment or delete to delete the last assignment.

## Technical Achievements
- **Created a Single-Page App**: All the sever data is shown below the HTML form and it auto updates with the curent data and the derived field from the server. The data is still displayed when refreshing the page as well as long as the server has not been restarted.

### Design Achievements
- **Had my Site Tested by Another Student**:
1. Rothschild
2. He said that it shouldn't allow negative values for dates and that there are no type constraints for the boxes. They also said that it wasn't odviios at first that it uses the current date to calculate the different values.
3. They liked the color pink that I chose.
4. I would make it so that all the entry fields have type constraints and maybe have instructions although I would keep the ability to have negative dates since you could hava an overdue assignment.
- **Had my Site Tested by Another Student**:
1. Lewis
2. He said that it shouldnn't allow blank entries to be submitted.
3. They liked the colors on the site.
4. I would make it so that there are checks for empty entries.

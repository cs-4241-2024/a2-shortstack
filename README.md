## Yarn Project Cost Calculator
This project takes input as a project name, an amount of yarn skeins, and the type of yarn, and sends the information to a server, which will save the data (as long as the server is running) and calculate how much the project will cost by multiplying amount of yarn by the yarn type cost (which is only on the server, this is the derived element), for the client to display in a table. Records can be removed with the 'remove' button and can be edited by submitting a new record with the same name (it overwrites on the server end, this is intentional functionality for edit). For formatting, display: flex was used (except in the table it broke the table really bad, so the table is default)


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: This is a single page app. The client sends to server, then rerenders with the data the server sends back.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: A user can modify existing data by submitting a record with the same name as an existing record. This causes the server to update the records it holds.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Yeah I didn't do these because talking to people is scary.

## Your Web Application Title
This webpage is an employee form that will take user input for an employee's ID, name, salary, and their ID registration date. It will then calculate the expiration
date for their ID by adding 5 years to the inputted registration date. Used a flexbox and the Ubuntu Google font for the CSS styling.
Instructions: Input a 9-digit number for the ID, a first and last name, a yearly salary of at least 5 digits, and an ID year (YYYY). Afterwards, just click the submit
button. You can also edit or delete a row by clicking the buttons to the right of the data.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-page app**: Both the submission form and the data table are displayed on the same page.
- **Edit Table Rows**: The viewer of the page is able to edit any data in any row of the displayed table.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Think-aloud**: No think-alouds were performed for this assignment.

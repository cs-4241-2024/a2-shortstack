Design/UX

(5 points per person, with a max of 10 points) Test your user interface with other students in the class. Define a specific task for them to complete (ideally something short that takes <10 minutes), and then use the think-aloud protocol to obtain feedback on your design (talk-aloud is also fine). Important considerations when designing your study:
Achievement 1:

Soofi
User thought the styling was inconsistent and looked a little all over the place
They said it felt more like an answer submission than somewhere they could write a long post to express themselves
I would have standard themes and font sizes
Achievement 2:

Cuccovia
User liked the blue color, but said he'd like to receive more feedback if he performs deleting or updating or creating
He would like current posts to have been at the side. And have key details. Also to make it clickable to view everything
I would make the containers clickable, have intuitive brief details for key identification and include it at the side.

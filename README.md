## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:
- My whole page is on one page, with a form and then a table with the responses right below.
**Tech Achievement 2**:
- Using a submit and delete button that has an on-click, the program looks to see if an element has changed, and then if it has the submit button records that arrays data sends it the server which then sends a response to the page. I also have the data saving to localdata in the website because refreshing was deleting the data and stackoverflow said this :)
